Which features did you implement? 
  (list features, or write 'Entire assignment')
  
  Entire Assignment. Added one safety feature to prevent unwanted behavior outside of assignment:
   - Socket timeouts: I noticed that it is possible to block a socket by connecting to telnet and not writing
                      anything. For a thread pool of size 2 and two telnet sessions, I could DOS my server.
                      With SocketTimeouts, I could alleviate this to a degree.
   
  

Did you complete any extra-credit tasks? If so, which ones?
  (list extra-credit tasks)
  None.

Any special instructions for building and running your solution?
  (include detailed instructions, or write 'None')

   Yes, my HTTP server uses some template HTML files in the resources folder when generating the html pages
      for the control page. "resources/" should be included in the classpath when running or the correct
      html page will not be displayed.

Did you personally write _all_ the code you are submitting
(other than code from the course web page)?
  [X] Yes
  [ ] No

Did you copy any code from the Internet, or from classmates?
  [X] Yes 
      - but only related to things like how to format the Date variables and sending bytes over a DataOutPutStream, 
         nothing related to the HTTP Server itself. 
  [ ] No

Did you collaborate with anyone on this assignment?
  [ ] Yes
  [X] No
